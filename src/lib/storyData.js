export const SAMPLE_STORY = `Pro's elongated fingers drummed against his thigh, counting the seconds until departure. The acrid smell of recycled air, tinged with the metallic tang of drive lubricant, filled his nostrils. Around him, passengers shifted nervously as the overhead lights dimmed from harsh fluorescence to a softer blue glow.

"Commencing FTL initiation," announced the automated system, its synthetic voice oddly melodic against the background hum of the engines. "Pulse synchronization recommended."

The shuttle emerged from FTL with a violent shudder that sent Pro's diagnostic tools clattering against the deck plates. Around him, passengers gasped and clutched their restraints as the vessel's reality alignment stabilized.

Outside the viewport, Nexus Station materialized from the distortionâ€”a massive ring structure orbiting a barren moon. Its outer hull was a patchwork of corporate logos and Cicillian Industries markings.

Pro made his way through the maintenance tunnels, his neural implants flickering as they interfaced with the station's systems. His chrome implants caught the light as he passed other technicians working on biometric scanners and holographic displays.

The corporate scanner identified him immediately, granting access to restricted areas. He moved through corporate space with practiced efficiency, avoiding Purist territory where his enhancements would mark him as a target.

His breathing techniques kept him synchronized with the Vankh pulse, preventing the onset of Dilation Hysteria that could affect unprotected minds during FTL transition. The temporal stabilizers in his kit would help others who weren't as well-trained.

The Prophet's followers had been increasing their attacks on corporate citizens, using anti-aircraft batteries to down shuttles carrying augmented passengers. The Church of Purity viewed any enhancement as heretical, a stark contrast to Cicillian Industries' promotion of technological integration.

Pro checked his corporate badge and adjusted his diagnostic tools. As a Drive Coupling Specialist, he had clearance to access even the most sensitive areas of the station, though the growing tension between corporate and Purist factions made travel increasingly dangerous.`;
